# ItemDisenchanter

## Description
A lightweight Minecraft plugin to enable transferring enchantments from an item to a book.

## Installation
Download the jar from [here](https://github.com/N15A8/ItemDisenchanter/tree/master/result) and put it into your server's plugin folder.

## Usage
Put an enchanted item and a regular book into a smithing table. This produces an enchanted book with all the enchantments of the item.
Taking the enchanted book out of the smithing table will remove all enchantments from the previously enchanted item and consume the book.

You are then left with an unenchanted version of your item aswell as the enchanted book.
